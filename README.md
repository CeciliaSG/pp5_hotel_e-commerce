- No error were found when passing the code through Python Linter: [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)
- No other errors were returned when passing through the official: [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### Lighthouse testing

- Mobile (third party cookies and Cloudinary are causing issues)
 <img src="assets_readme/images/lighthouse_mobile.png">

 Comment: There is still some work to be done with regards to sizing of images etc.

- Desktop (third party cookies and Cloudinary are causing issues)
 <img src="assets_readme/images/lighthouse_desktop.png">


### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Iphone and Ipad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly and that buttons, other links and forms are working.

### Features Left to Implement

- The Admin panel needs to be developed and made better. It works but it is not ideal for adding treatments/service, dates and times.
- Also employees/users should be able to adminstrate the treatments etc. from the front end.
- Customers should also be able to choose a therapist when booking.
- The prices section should be developed.

## Creating the Heroku app, deploying to Heroku

Steps to follow for deployment to Heroku:

### In GitHub.
1. Navigate to the repository for the project. 

### In Heroku

1.  Go to Heroku, create account, if you don't have one, and log in.
2.  Go to the dashboard and click New after which you click Create new app
3.  Choose name and region. Click Create app
4.  Go to Settings, under the "Config Vars" set your Key/Value Pairs.
    You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`
    If you have credentials, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.
    When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:
    1. `heroku/python`
    2. `heroku/nodejs`

5.  In the Buildpacks section, add buildpacks. Note order in which you add buildpacks: Python first and nodejs.
6.  No go to Deployment. In deployment method click on "GitHub"(for repository)
7.  The connect to GitHub, find your repository and click  connect.
8.  Under connect to GitHub-section, you can either chose automatic deploys with Enable Automatic Deploys or Manual Deploy, to deploy manually.
    
    **Now you can view the deployed app.**
